# Customer Segmentation Analysis


#### -- Project Status: [Active, On-Hold, Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is use customer purchase data to group customers based on their purchase behaviors and
Lay the foundation in the development of a business plan to create a target market and improve customer satisfaction. 


## Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* etc.

## Technologies 
* Python
* Seaborn
* Plotly Express
* Pandas, jupyter
* Scikit-learn
* ipywidget
* KMeans
* etc. 

## Project Description
This project performs analyzis of customer purchase behaviors by revealing the clusters customers fall into and how these clusters interact with the company's shops.
The dataset used in the project is a city retail market data from an Italian distribution company called Coop. The dataset contains data aggregated from customers 
and information from the shops and pivoted to new columns made up of 40 features(coulumns) and 60366 instances(rows).
I used a couple of methods to perform the analysis. 
* PCA for reduction of dimentionality by decomposing and tranforming the features into principal components (PC) and linear variance of the data.
* K-Means clustering is used to find the clusters, it is a fast algorithm mostly used fo customer segmentation especially for numerical data and it does well with large datasets.
* Random Forest Classification is used to train the dataset and identify the most important features.
* Plotly Express, Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualization in 3D.
